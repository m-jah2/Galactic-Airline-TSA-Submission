        <p>Do you remember those instances in your infancy when you wondered about what lies beyond the boundaries of
          our world? Maybe you, like countless other kids, dreamed of becoming an astronaut and seeing the marvels that
          the cosmos has to offer. Unfortunately, that passion started to fade away as we got older, labeling it as
          impossible due to the training, cost, time, and other relevant matters. However, here at Galactic Airlines, we
          want to resurrect that hope and illusion that once illuminated countless of young faces when they thought
          about walking on the moon, by giving an opportunity for regular people to complete training at a reasonable
          cost.</p>

          The program will use the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket for the launch; a reliable rocket with an excellent track
          record of successful launches, which has been used in many space missions in the past.

              The program will begin with an initial screening process, where applicants will have to undergo rigorous
              physical and mental evaluations to ensure they are fit for space travel. Once selected, the participants
              will undergo extensive training that will last for around six months. The training will include classroom
              lectures, physical fitness, and survival training, medical training, and simulation exercises in
              space-like conditions.

                  Safety is of utmost importance in space travel. The participants will be provided with advanced space
                  suits that will protect them from the harsh space environment. The rocket and the spacecraft will
                  undergo extensive testing and quality checks to ensure they are safe for the participants. There will
                  also be a team of highly trained professionals who will monitor the launch and the mission to ensure
                  the safety of the participants.

                      The launch will take place from Cape Canaveral in Florida, USA. The participants will be launched
                      into space aboard the SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft. The spacecraft will be attached to the Falcon
                      9 rocket, which will provide the necessary thrust to get the spacecraft into orbit.
